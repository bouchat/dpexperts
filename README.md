Replication data and code for "Engaging Experts"


This repository contains 4 R script files, as well as subsidiary C++ files to estimate Dirichlet Process clusters. 

EngagingExperts-JWmodels.R provides code for the linear model and extension of results from Jackman and Western (1994) alongside additional hypothetical expert priors.

EngagingExperts-clusterexampleplots.R provides code for clustering simulations and visualizations that vary the number of experts, questions, and covariates in hypothetical models.

EngagingExperts-appendixplots.R provides code for the confusion matrices in the supplementary materials.

bayeslm.R provides code necessary to estimate Bayesian OLS.



Replication data for the Jackman and Western (1994) models was provided by the authors and is available upon request.
